Note: The rows in input/weights represent the neurons in the current layer
and the columns represent the neurons in the previous layer
The bias is a single value for each neuron in the current layer
for example 3x4 matrix for input, 3x4 matrix for weights, and 1x3 matrix for biases
there are 3 neurons in the current layer and 4 neurons in the previous layer
the output will be a 3x3 matrix
